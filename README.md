# HideMyBenis
Steganographic software that hides files in images.

Build info:
You need to install the sodium library (https://download.libsodium.org/doc/).
The rudimentary FindSodium.cmake expects either the CMake variable SODIUM_ROOT set to the root of the library, or alternatively, the system environment variable SODIUM_ROOT set accordingly.
